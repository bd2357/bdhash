# bdhash
Because evey C programmer should write a hash map package once in their lives.

Generic hash map with configurable hash size and flexible keys and values.
Currently uses hash of lists and the key compare is not efficent.
Supports static and extendable maps since if used in embedded there is often no useful malloc
